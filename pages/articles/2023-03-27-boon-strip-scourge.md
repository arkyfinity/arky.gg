# Boon Strip Scourge
<p class="article-date">Written on March 27th, 2023</p>

<factBox class="variant mb-2">

**Initial note**: _Tooltip values will be off (aka showing PvE values), since I'm piggy-backing off GW2Armory which essentially pings the GW2 API. The API rarely exposes the WvW and/or PvP splits, and if exposed, the way it's done isn't always clear. But without tooltips, the page seems a bit less alive._

</factBox>

This is not your regular meta build. This is theorycrafted for a specific purpose: boon strips. Normally, Scourges are expected to be top damage dealers _as well as_ stripping boons. And while this build doesn't lack damage per se, there are more dps-y alternatives out there that you might want to check out first, if that's your kink.
