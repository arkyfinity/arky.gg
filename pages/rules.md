# Twitch Affiliate Anniversary Stream

Thank you for your interest in my anniversary stream, as we're celebrating me being Twitch affiliate for a whole year! The stream will take place on [January 6th, 2021 starting at 8pm EU time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20210106T190000&p1=tz_cet&p2=tz_gmt&p3=tz_pst&p4=tz_aedt). During this stream I will participate in PvE raids with various streamers, friends, and viewers. And there will be celebration giveaways for everyone watching the stream.

During the stream I will also host a guessing competition (see below), and show interesting statistics and data from 12 months of WvW.

## Rules

Some rules have to be enforced to make it fair for everyone.

- You can only enter once per category. Categories are:
  - Ectos
  - Black Lion skins
  - Dyes
  - Infusions
  - Mystic Coins
  - Pre-cursors
  - Heavy Loot Bags
  - Legendaries
  {.rules-sub-list}
- Giveaways within categories will be run in succession - which means you enter once per category, and multiple winners will be drawn. This is done to save time.
- You cannot enter with multiple accounts. Mods will do their best to verify, and if a winner is found to attempting to cheat and win more than once, this will result in a ban.
- You must be a follower of the stream to win. If your name is drawn, and you're not following before the draw, your prize will be forfeit and there will be a re-roll.
{.rules-list}

## How to enter

To enter a giveaway for a category, you "buy" tickets with "tokens" by typing `!win <1-10>` in Twitch chat. 1 (one) ticket cost `10` tokens, which means that if you want to buy the maximum amount of tickets, you must have `10 x 10` (100) tokens to enter. You can only enter once, and you cannot change your amount of tickets bought after entering a giveaway. Buying tickets for tokens is not token-refundable, and neither broadcaster or mods will add tokens back.

You earn these tokens during the stream simply by watching. These are channel currency [handled by Streamlabs](https://blog.streamlabs.com/cloudbot-101-loyalty-points-82bfb24c93db) and are tied to your Twitch account. Thus, anonymous viewers and/or viewers without a Twitch account will not earn tokens. Tokens are not to be confused with "[Channel Points](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/channel-points-guide)", which is a currency handled by Twitch. Same way as tokens, you don't earn Channel Points without a Twitch account. You can only use tokens to enter and you only earn tokens by watching the stream. You cannot purchase tokens for real money, but don't worry as they're earned quite fast and free of charge:


- 100 tokens every 10 minutes
- 50 additional tokens every 10 minutes if Twitch considers you "active"
- 300 tokens on following
- 1000 tokens on subscribing
- 1 bit equals 1 token
{.rules-list .tokens}

Subscribers get 5 extra bonus tickets as a "token" of appreciation (pun intended).

Mods and VIPs can enter the giveaway and/or competition on the same terms as regular viewers. Mods and VIPs don't get bonus tickets unless they are also a subscriber.

Stream activity participants can also enter on the same terms as regular viewers. Same bonus rules apply.

Viewes cannot give their tokens to others. This is to make it more fair to viewes that have earned their tokens. Want more tokens? Watch the stream.

You can check your current token balance by typing `!tokens` in Twitch chat at any time.

## Prizes

The following prizes are available:

- 10&times; 250 Ectos (10 winners)
- Various Black Lion skins (8 winners)
- 1&times; Shadow Abyss dye
- 1&times; Permafrost dye
- 1&times; Ghostly Infusion
- 2&times; 125 Mystic Coins (2 winners)
- 1&times; Dawn (Sunrise pre-cursor)
- 1&times; Dusk (Twilight pre-cursor)
- 1&times; Bolt
- 1&times; Twilight
{.rules-list}

## Heavy Loot Bags Competition

Throughout 2020 I collected every Heavy Loot Bag from kills in WvW. Slotted in between the giveaway of pre-cursors and legendaries, I will start a guessing competition, where viewers can guess how many WvW-kills I managed, by the amount of loot bags I got.

You enter your guess by typing `!guess <number>` in chat. **You can only enter once**, so think about your guess before entering. You cannot change your guess, the same way you cannot change the amount of tickets entered in a giveaway.

The winner is the entry getting closest to the correct number, of which I will reveal once the timer has run out.

The winner will receive every loot bag. However, the winner can also choose to let me open them all on stream, and receive the contents they choose.
